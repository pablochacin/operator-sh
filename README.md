# Operator-sh

A framework for implementing Kubernetes Operators as shell scripts

## Goals
The main objective of operator-sh is to facilitate the development of kubernetes operators using approaches familiar to the Devops. 

- Flatten the learning curve for DevOps
- Test k8s automation ideas easily

To achieve these goals, the `operator-sh` framework follows the design principles below:
* Simplicity first.
* Extensibility by means of hooks and extensive configuration
* Easy to use locally, with simple drop and use setup and minimal dependencies

## Usage

```
    Watch for events and process them using scripts

    Usage: ./operator.sh [OPTIONS...]

    Options
    -a,--added: name of the hook for ADDED events. Default is 'added.sh'
    -c,--changes-only: do not received ADDED events for existing objects
    -d,--deleted: name of hook for DELETED events. Default is 'deleted.sh'
    -e,--log-events: log received events to log file
    -h,--hooks: path to hooks. Default is 'hooks/'
    -l,--log-file: path to the log. Default is /var/log/operator-sh.log
    -L,--log-level: log level ("DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR") 
    -k,--kubeconfig: path to kubeconfig file for accessing Kubernetes cluster
    -m,--modified: name of the hook for MODIFIED events. Default is modified.sh'
    -n,--namespace: namespace to watch (optional)
    -o,--object: type of object to watch
    -q,--queue: queue to store events
    -r,--reset-queue: reset queue to delete any pending event from previous executions
    -R,--reset-log: reset log delete messages from previous executions
    -s,--filter-spec: filter object spec from event
    -S,--filter-status: filter object status from event
    --help: display this help

```

## Examples

This section shows different examples of using `operator-sh` for automating cluster management with shell scripts.

In the following examples we use [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind) for running a local cluster. If you don't have it already installed, please check [installation instructions](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation).

Unless explicitly stated, we assume you have created a default cluster. Please notice the exact output can vary depending on the version of `kind` you are using.

```
$ kind create cluster
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.15.0) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ 
 ‚úì Creating kubeadm config üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
Cluster creation complete. You can now use the cluster with:

export KUBECONFIG="$(kind get kubeconfig-path --name="kind")"
kubectl cluster-info
```

Remember that when running the operator in any other terminal than the one on which you created the cluster, you must ensure the `kubeconfig` file is available to the operator or any other tool, such as `kubectl`.

```
$ export KUBECONFIG="$(kind get kubeconfig-path --name="kind")"
```

### Logging Pod creation

In this example we will simply log each pod that is created. For doing so, we will use a simple script located in `examples/pods/added.sh` which logs every pod added event received and dumps the content of the enrironment variables with the fields from the event:

```
#!/bin/bash

source lib/log.sh

log_info "Processing event ${EVENT_TYPE} for object ${EVENT_OBJECT_KIND}/${EVENT_OBJECT_METADATA_NAME}"
log_debug "$(env | grep 'EVENT_' | sort)"

```

1. In one terminal start the operator using the example script for monitoring pod creation at `examples/pods/added.sh`. Redirect the log to /tmp/operator-sh.log (default is located at `/var/log/operator-sh.log`)

```
$ ./operator.sh -o pod --hooks examples/pods -R -l /tmp/operator-sh.log -L DEBUG
```

2. In another terminal, start watching the log 

```
$ tail -f /tmp/operator-sh.log
```

3. In another terminal, create a deployment with one replica

```
$ kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx
deployment.apps/nginx created

```

4. In the terminal on which you are tailing the log, you should see these messages:

```
20-09-04 22:09:12 INFO Processing event "ADDED" for object "Pod"/"nginx-554b9c67f9-8m7qq"
20-09-04 22:09:12 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:09:12 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:09:12 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
```

Notice that as there is not hook for the `MODIFIED` event, these events are ignored by `operator-sh`

5. Back in the `kubectl` terminal (on which you created the deployment) increase the number of replicas to create more pods:

```
$ kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
```

You should see these new messages in the log:

```
20-09-04 22:09:58 INFO Processing event "ADDED" for object "Pod"/"nginx-554b9c67f9-xs4zz"
20-09-04 22:09:59 INFO Processing event "ADDED" for object "Pod"/"nginx-554b9c67f9-sjrsk"
20-09-04 22:09:59 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:09:59 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:09:59 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:09:59 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:10:00 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
20-09-04 22:10:00 DEBUG No event handler exits for event "MODIFIED". Ignoring.
```

6. Modify the script `examples/pods/added.sh` and change the log level to `LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG`. Back in the kubectl terminal, increase the number of replicas to 4 `$ kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 4`. You should see now the following in the log file:

## Design

The operator-sh framework architecture is described in the figure below

```
                       + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +        +----------+
    +--------+         ¬∑  +-------+           +---------+  ¬∑      +---------+  |

    |        |         ¬∑  +-------+           +---------+  ¬∑    +--------+
    +--------+         ¬∑       |                   ^  ^    ¬∑
                       + - - - - - - - - - - - - - + -+- - +   +--------+
                               |   +-------------+ |  |        |  Json  |
                               +-->| event queue |-+  +------->| Parser |
                                   +-------------+             +--------+
```

The operator process consists of two sub-processes:
* watch: connects to the K8s cluster and watches for events on an object type, sending the events to a queue as a json object.
* process: reads events from the queue and process them sequentially. Each event is parsed and converted to a series of environment variables, as described en the section `Json Parsing`. These variables are used to initialize the environment for the event handling scripts.
* event handlers: each event type (ADDED, MODIFIED, DELETED) is handled by an external script provided by the user. This scripts are executed as sub-processes and received an environment with the content of the event and other setup information (for example, the path to the kubeconfig file to connect to the cluster)

### Json parsing

The events are transformed in a series of environment variables. This parser is adapted from the [k8s-operator](https://github.com/side8/k8s-operator). Consider the following json corresponding to the creation of a Pod:

It will transformed to the environment variables shown bellow. Some aspects to highlight:
* Every element is named prefixing the name of all of the elements to the root of the event
* A prefix (by default, `EVENT` is added to each variable to prevent name collision with other existing variables
* Elements of arrays are referenced by their position (index)

## Development

### Testing

The `operator-sh` is tested using a minimalistic testing framework defined in `lib/test.sh`. This framework provides some functions for executing commands and assert the results. In order to use these functions in your test, you must include them into your test script:

```
source ../lib/test.sh
```

The operator tests are defined under the `test` directory. The example below executes the `parse.py` command and verifies it properly parses the event into environment variables:

```
#!/bin/bash

source ../lib/test.sh

# Test default parsing with the event.json input
Test "../parse.py" "event.json"
assert_command_rc 0
assert_output_contains "EVENT_TYPE="
assert_equals 74 $(wc -l <<< $TEST_OUTPUT)
```

The framework can be also used to test functions in a script. For instance:

```
#!/bin/bash

source ../lib/test.sh

# include the operator source code
source ../operator.sh

# Test invalid argument option
Test "parse_args --invalid-option"
assert_command_rc 1
assert_output_contains "Invalid parameter"
assert_output_contains "--invalid-option"
assert_output_contains "Usage"
```

However, in order to prevent the script's main logic to be executed when sourcing in into your test script, you can follow the convention of wrapping your main logic as shown below:

```
# main logic
function main(){

}

## if sourced into another script, do not execute main logic
if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" == "$0" ]; then
    main $@
fi
```

## Road Map

* Provide examples
* Create image and k8s manifests for deploying operators
* Implement e2e tests
* Implement a library for managing CRDs (create, update)

## Inspired by 

* [k8s-operator](https://github.com/side8/k8s-operator)
* [shell-operoator](https://github.com/flant/shell-operator)
